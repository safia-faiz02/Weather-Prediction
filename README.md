# Weather-Prediction
This was my Complex Engineering Problem (CEP) project assigned in Machine Learning course. Me and my group member S. M. Mubashir Rizvi have created four models for it to be trained and tested on the provided dataset. We chose to work with the following models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP).
